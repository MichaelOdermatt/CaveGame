title: Cave

The cave is a home.
Our bodies are our homes which inhernitly skew our perspectives.
platos cave
conspiracy theorys and their religous devotees.
Since you play as an inhuman being, the text could be really analytical. for example the chemical process of breathing could be describe instead of just saying the man is breathing?
Want to primarily use imagery
Since this doesn't take place in a specific time, imagery from every era could be used
greek Four Temperaments / Humors

But you, consious spirit of truth. Go to the _Omphalos_, find them and give me their names.

It's the end of the world. There are 4 surving humans, trapped in a cave.

"It's over. It was all our fault. We desrved it."

"I know we are not the last ones. There is no way. Maybe one day they will find us down here."

"I'm not sitting around in this cave much longer. I can find a way out."

"This really isn't so bad. We survived. Thank god"


The cave has some strange power where the men don't die
A magical well they were put in there as babies

A cave with no women in it.

The cave is quite ugly.
There are territories inside the cave that mark off people's sections.
There is a rich history of conflict in the cave.
Only one person has ever died in the cave and thier territory was taken by the invader.
Lots of complex relations between the countries.
Since its always dark in the cave they use a different way of measureing time.
The sole proprieters of the caves countries are very nationalistic.
In one of the countries there is a slightly malphormed rock. It is considered one of the wonders of the cave.
Each coutries leader would be one of the above archetyps. For example the artist would be the dead one.




You are a lost member of an expedition into the cave.

"
The bridge croaked as you crept across it. Stopping, to give the thing a breif moment of rest, you traded a quick glance with __ and Dr.__. Them, meters behind you, eagarly standing there on the comfortable end of the situation, could at this point only aid you with emotional support.
    'Keep going, boy! You're doing great' the doctor said with an excited smile. 'You'll be fine. You're already Halfway there!'.
Somehow his words were far less reassuring now. Which was likely due to that strange sensation at your feet. Feeling at once both stable, and completely unsupported. Like the boards were only held in place by some buoyant force from the chasm below. Regaurdless you pressed on. 

Step after step, the boards, or maybe the rope holding them, gave irritated groans. But you kept going, inching closer and closer to the other side. It wasn't until you were nearly within arms reach of the end that the ropes snapped. You tried to scream but your chest seized. The planks and rope shot together in a big tangle around you, hardly looking like a bridge anymore. Dispite that you held onto it, digging your fingernails into the thing and the idea that bridges are supposed suspend their occupants. But unfortunately that heap was now more of an anchor than a bridge.

You held on as it drove you far into the black chamber below.
...
"

You explore the spooky cave finding little objects. You eventually find a hidden section of the cave.

You find a human skeleton.
A huge metal locked door.
Strange noises.
Things moving in the dark.
Childrens toys.

You come across a very old withered man. You listen to his crazy he tries to convince you everything is a lie and to stay down there with him, and hide in that secret chamber when the rescue team arrives.

Or maybe, you find the withered old man and he tells you the truth. He tells you its all it all means nothing, asks you what you were even looking for.

You get to choose. To stay or leave

"
Ah, they sent another one. 
"

Small cave town feeding off of information and culture that trickes into the cave. Maybe its at the bottom of a well.

There is a small hole high up on the roof the the cave where sunlight comes in, ocassionally things fall down that hole, other times water falls down it.

A novel fell down the hole, the residents of the town don't realize its army propaganda (or something political). They completely mis-understand what its actual meaning is.

You play as a resident of the town. As a resident nothing about this town seems wrong. as a player everything about it seems off.



The world was a vibrant but hostile place. Then aliens came colonised the world. Killing the local population. Driving its survivors underground. Killing aything that seemed remotely hostile on the planet.
Rebuilding, redesigning its climate, ecosystem.

The navies are not humans, they are very short men that built travel networks through the caves.

You commited some crime, as punshment for you have been exiled into the cave system under the city. All you have is a flashlight.

In the cave you find notes. And strange creatures, hear whispers.

You find notes from someone who was previously exiled

Do you find what's left of the native population?

"
My grandfather would tell me stories of life when we first arived to this planet.

Stores about the old world. A place teeming with life. Bitterly hostile.

Ticks the size of apples, dropping from trees.
Teething pups, carving inch-deep groves into stone.
Winters so cold the first colonists would be forced underground.
Constant hunger. 

He would tell me that we brought something beautiful to the land. Tamed the parameters of our world.

We should be proud of the suffering we've driven off.
"

"
I remember once hearing that extended periods of isolation can lead to hallucinations, delusions. That and the way this place reverberates and manipulates sounds...

It's terrifying. I'd feel much safer with some kind of weapon.
"

"
In a way time sits still down here.

I could be walking for what feels like hours then look at my watch and realize its only been minutes. Lay down to close my eyes and wake up six hours later. 

Not that it matters what time it is. It's not like I'll be leaving.
"

"
I think I saw my mother. Standing at the edge of my periphery.

I could make out her wiery frame. Her face, clear in its distinction. Deeply set in her head like an old stone monuemnt.
"

"
The deeper I go, the stranger sounds get. Not long ago I swear I could hear voices. Small voices. Mumbiling something I couldn't make out.
perhaps in some other language?

I can't tell if what I'm hearing is real.
"

You eventually find him.

"
Let me tell you. They lied to us. This planet had intelligent life. They drove them underground, into hiding. But we've been working on something.
We're gonna fight back. Take it all back.
"



You've come to the cave to obtain a great gemstone.
The cave is a place teeming with life all in delicate balance. All the creatures beg you not to take the gemstone. It has great but dangerous power.
you don't listen and keep going. 


Fleeing from the cold you take shelter in the cave. You hear noises and voices intising you inside. You find notes talking of a great treasure at the center of the cave.
You go deeper and deeper.

You are swollowed whole by the cave.



You are a man who is escaping is problems. Running from life, inside a cave. At the start of the game you drop a note at the entrence of the cave, explaining why you are fleeing from socioty.

You go through the cave. The atmoshpgere is kinda spooky. You see these little creatures running around. Eyes poking out of the dark at you.

You eventually find a little camp of them. They are roasting some of the big bugs you came across earlier. One of them has a phone and is scrolling on social media.

They are some kind of tiny human reptile hybrid. There species is passive, unmotivated by progress. They are not angry with humanity, to them it is a magnificent thing. Beautiful and terrible. They are almost extinct. The group you find is the largest of their colonies left alive. They are approaching extinction. In this species, an individuals lifespan is much longer than humans.

You explore the cave and eventually wander into their camp.

Need some kind of branching dialogue system.

Your note at the beginning:


You:
You can talk?

Reptile:
We all can. The others were just teasing you.

You:
Who are you?

Reptile:
We suspect, a species of reptiles. Predating humanity homo sapiens many many years. As for where we come from. We do not know. Maybe we evolved from lizards. Maybe we came from space. Your science eclipses ours. Ours, a masked form of yours. Full of misunderstandings a vaugue impressions. We only suspect we are older than you, because of what knowlege was passed down to us from our elders.

You:
Come back with me.

Reptile:
While age brings wisdom on an individual level. The same cannot be said on a sociotal level. We have nothing to give you. We want nothing from you. No good will come to either of us from that. We do not want to interfere. Though, maybe some day...

You:
If you didn't want to be seen then why reveal yourselves to me? 

Reptile:
Our curiosity. Plus, one alone, is powerless. This is not the first time we've interacted, or even spoken, to humans.

You:
What if I took photos or videos. I have a reputation. I could reveal you to the world.

Reptile:
Photos and Videos wouldn't mean anything. We already have an instagram page. It has 72 followers. Plus Your friends and colleuges would sooner believe you've lost your mind, than believe you've found talking lizards. Even with photo evidence. Thoes things can be easily fabricated these days...


Reptile:
We are not propriatarian. We are not domineering or expansionistic. The rate at which our world moves, when compared to yours, is as imperceptible as water eroding stone.


You:
What do you make of us?

Reptile:
In most ways you are magnificent. Architects of everything. You reduce the systems of the world into thier basic components. Correct the inherit brutality out of those systems. You've cured plauges, starvation, death. And so much more...
Creatures of complexity. Your cities, countries, are living things. Changing, adapting. Forcing their will onto the land and it's inhabitants.

In some ways you are terrible. In equal measure your will inflicts immeasurable pain on everything around you. But most of that pain falls back on you. You suffer immensley for the speed at which you redefine the world. Genocide, Slavery, these are some of the other things you've invented.

But the collective human organism is not stagnant. Larger than any one human it is flows and changes constantly. It is brutally self aware. Self critical. Self correcting. To look a snapshot of humanity as representing the entire human project, through time, is wrong. It's constantly re-inventing itself. Building a better version of itself. progressing through thoes painful moments, with thoes painful memories.

What I mean is I cannot judge you.
I cannot reduce you to some binary of good or evil. 


After talking to the leader he runs off and jumps into a little hole. While you were talking to him all the other ones left too. You can wander around their abandoned camp for a bit. When you eventually decide to leave. The game ends.




You explore the cave and find skeletons that you can talk to

third Skeleton:

You get into the final room and find a skeleton on the floor. Beside the skeleton is half a broken ladder.
The is a hole in the top of the cave that leads to sunlight

talking:

Some things we never grow out of...

When I was a boy I would always come down here to get away from the world. If I did something that made mom and dad angry, when my brothers were being jerks, Or when I just wanted to be someplace away from it all. This was that place.

Even as I got older. After the kids. I held on to this place.

Kept it a secret from everyone, even Sue...

I honestly don't think I regret it anymore. 

But that doesn't explain why I'm still here.


Second Skeleton:

Damn thing durn colapsed on top of me.

Serves me right for being such a fool.

ere day, breaking my back for everyone else.

...

Pa always said ghosts was just tired old places remembering people.

If thats true I sure wish this place would forget me.

Then I could get some rest.


First Skeleton:

Hm?

Oh, you're one of the ones that hear the dead. I see...

What do they call you? _Ambient_ or something?

Well there isn't much to dig for here. My story's a closed book.





The title of the game could be called: "Good Company"

A game about feeling screwed over by odler generations.

They are either skeletons or very old withered people who looks miserible

Every time you interact with them they say something.

Second Skeleton:

Not what you expected, huh?

...

If it makes you feel any better, this place was just as much of a _shit-hole_ when I got here.

...

This is just the way things are.

...

Once you outgrow your mothers arms you'll never find a comfort like that ever again.


First Skeleton:

Oh, I'll find the lord... One day.

...

What if I was once just as afraid of being born as I am now of dying.

...

Let me impart some wisdom on you, son. Don't try.

...

The governmening folk used to come to town, round up all the criminals, tie bags of gold 'round their ankles and throw them in the river.

...

We'd be forced to watch. Them, frantically trying to untie themselves.


Third Skeleoton Wears a shirt that says Life is Good





Working Title: So when I die this will all be yours

The cave is the system and belief itself

Colorectal cancer is something which typically only affects older generations, it spreading to younger generations could represent a narrative of inheritance, passing something down. Something wholly bad.
Having the cancerous colon being the place that the player exists, reflects climate change, inheriting a broken and dying place from your elders.



Eyes peering in:
~~What a strange victory.~~
If There is no victory. If there was defeat. Would you keep going?

- or we could go back to book narration -
Two narrow eyes peer through the opening.


~~This place looks a lot different from out here. Maybe you can close your eyes and try to imagine it.~~

...

~~And what good is a fortress thats walls are paper thin.~~


Article on the Ground:
Rates of colorectal cancer in younger adults have been on the rise since the early 2000's. Oncologists are scratching there heads as to why.


Old bones:

Not for you?

This place never forgot you.

Just keep trying.

Beacuse really, it's a square deal any way you cut it...

Everyone gets an even side.

...

Go back up there. It's not too late.

- or - 

Dad:

You guys have it so good, you know?

Everything I did, I did it so you could get a better start than I did.

So, when I die this will all be yours.

...

We're products of our environment.

we've little control over who we turn into.

- or we could go back to book narration (maybe interacting with the old man should tell a story) -

Old man holding a peice of paper:
Finding the deed was dificult. Rifling through montains of papers, mostly comprised of old magazines and daily bulletins he for some odd reason felt compelled to keep.
Sorting through the papers, I abruptly stopped after reading the headline "More Young People Than Ever Will Get Colorectal Cancer This Year". It struck me because of how relevent it felt in that moment.
Was it bad to be angry when I'd heard who he was leaving the lake house too?




Very simple game. Go through spooky cave, people warn you not to keep going. you keep going and its nice at the end



*Once you enter the big chamber you hear nice slow guitar music with a lot of reverb*

Text scrolling over the screen:

I wan't you to close your eyes and imagine yourself someplace else.
Can you do that for me.

Imagine somewhere sunny. With trees and birds.
Water trickling over rocks.
Wind moving through the branches.

Let it actually take you somewhere else.

Forget whats around you.

Is it helping?

Keep going.




You find an old man at the bottom of the cave:

I'M SAVED!!!

I've been down here for over 200 years.

Pleese son, tell me! What is the world like out there?

"Its GREAT!"

"It's terrible."

"I'm stuck in here too..."



Man looking at ceiling:
LET US OUT, YOU HEAVING MASS!

NASTY WENCH!

RETCH! RETCH! RETCH!, SAYS I!

EXPOSE! GUSH AND SPOUT! BURST YOUR DEPTHS!


Man near campfire:
Alas the earth has swollowed us whole!

May we all enjoy her aweful beauty ~~from the inside~~!


Man stuck in the wall:
I WILL be regurgitated.

OR

I'm stuck in the fuckin' wall.
